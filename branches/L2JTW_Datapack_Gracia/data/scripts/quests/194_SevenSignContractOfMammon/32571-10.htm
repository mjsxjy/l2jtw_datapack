<html><body>Secret Agent Colin:<br>
This time, you will be transformed into an adult using the high-level transformation skill.<br>
The time of this transformation is even shorter than frog or child transformation.<br>
While waiting for you, I heard a passing villager say that he was headed to the <font color="LEVEL">Coliseum</font> to help with the repair work. Approach him and get one of his belongings.<br>
Use the <font color="LEVEL">skill</font> that helps you move faster, such as <font color="LEVEL">Fast running</font>, to reach him as soon as possible. Are you ready?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 194_SevenSignContractOfMammon 32571-11.htm">Say yes.</a><br>
<font color="LEVEL">(The transformation will cancel all movement-related buffs, including the PC room buff, other than energy buffs.)</font>
