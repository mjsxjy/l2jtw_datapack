朱德：

You don't have 200 evil weapons yet? Hunt the<font color="LEVEL"> monsters in the Hellbound Island</font>, you should be able to obtain them. Keep trying! Collect<font color="LEVEL"> 200 </font>evil weapons and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nice piece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon.
<br>
或者將魔物的武器5個交換成S80級武器破片3個也行。
