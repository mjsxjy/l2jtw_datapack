<html><head><body>Mercenary Captain:<br>Mobility is a basic skill of all mercenaries.
What's really needed in a large-scale battle is striders, of course.<br>
A mercenary company receives striders when it signs a contract with a lord.
Then we assigne them to individual mercenaries.
If you need one, bring enough badges to prove your skill.<br>
I think <font color="LEVEL">%striderBadge%</font> should be enough.<br><br>
