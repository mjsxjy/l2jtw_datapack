<html><body>Secret Agent Colin:<br>
Ah, you've brought the <font color="LEVEL">Native's Gloves</font>. Good work!<br>
Thanks to your diligence, you have completed all the training exercises. After you left for the last mission, Sir Gustav Athebalt's wife, <font color="LEVEL">Lady Claudia</font>, contacted me.<br>
She wanted me to send you to her when your training is completed.<br>
She will tell you the next steps in this operation.<br>
You will find her in <font color="LEVEL">the outer ring of the Town of Aden</font>.<br>
Go see her at once!
