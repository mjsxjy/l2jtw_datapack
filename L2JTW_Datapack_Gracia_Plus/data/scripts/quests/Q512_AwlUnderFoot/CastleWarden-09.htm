<html><body>Detention Camp Warden:<br>
I am the Detention Camp Warden of this castle. This underground monster camp was recently discovered.<br>
I know that other castles also have camps like this. My duty is to keep this dungeon camp area safe.<br>
After all, it would hardly be desirable to have monsters appearing and disappearing in the dungeon of a castle, would it?<br>
Unfortunately, we simply can't handle this job alone.<br>
We need help from the clan members.<br>
We'll compensate you for your help, naturally.<br>
