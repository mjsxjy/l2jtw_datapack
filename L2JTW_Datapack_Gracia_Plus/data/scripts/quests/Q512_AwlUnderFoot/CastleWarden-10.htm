<html><body>Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Enter the castle dungeon and slay the prisoners you find there.<br>
Your task is to eliminate the <font color="LEVEL">3 groups</font> so that the remaining evil creatures can be destroyed. Kill the leader of the <font color="LEVEL">last group</font>, and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Dungeon Leader Mark</font>.<br>
In return, I'll give you the Knight's Epaulette, which you can use to exchange the clan's supplies from a supply general.<br>
The dungeon leaders we've identified so far are <font color="LEVEL">Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer</font>.<br>
I can admit you to the castle dungeon right now.<br>
